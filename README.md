### Project Structure

```text
nuvio-providers/
├── src/                    # Source code (one folder per provider)
│   ├── utils/              # Shared logic (Resolvers, HTTP helpers)
│   └── [provider]/
│       ├── index.js        # Entry point (exports getStreams)
│       └── extractor.js    # HTML/API extraction logic
├── providers/              # Compiled and minified files (do not edit directly)
├── manifest.json           # Plugin registry
└── build.js                # Bundling script (based on esbuild)
```

### Development Setup

1. **Installation**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Create a new provider**:
   Create a folder in `src/` inspired by existing providers. Ensure you export a function `getStreams(tmdbId, mediaType, season, episode)`.

3. **Build**:
   ```bash
   # Build and minify all plugins
   npm run build

   # Build in watch mode (development)
   npm run build:watch
   ```

### Code Conventions
- Use `cheerio` (imported as `cheerio-without-node-native`) for HTML parsing.
- Import `resolveStream` from `../utils/resolvers.js` to process your final URLs.
- Always use `fetchText` or `fetchJson` wrappers located in standard `http.js` utilities to inject correct headers and avoid Cloudflare blocks.
- Prefer `fetch` (Hermes compatible) over heavy external libraries.
